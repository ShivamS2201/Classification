# Classification
This repository includes the different Machine Learning projects which can be used for educational purposes
#### CHURN RATE CLASSIFIER :
Includes the churn rate prediction using dataset from a bank. In this different types of steps are shown which are necessary for preparing your model i.e. Data visualzation, pre- processing. Different classifiers - Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN.

#### IRIS-KNN :
I have used the K - nearest neighbours to classify the class label of the Iris data set(Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, Iris virginica).
The value of K was initialised to some value, later I ran a for loop to check the highest accuracy(in test set).

#### Fuel_Consumption-SLR :
I have used the Simple Linear Regression to predict values of CO2Emissions depending upon various parameters.
Used a special way of distributing Train and Test datasets.
